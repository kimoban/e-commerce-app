# EComShop Backend Slide Deck

---

## Project Overview

- **E-Commerce Backend**: Powers the business logic, data storage, and API for the e-commerce platform.
- **Framework**: Built with Django, a high-level Python web framework known for rapid development and clean design.
- **Database**: Uses PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database.
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for products, users, orders, and payments, enabling frontend and third-party integrations.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery handles background tasks (e.g., emails, order processing).
- **Monitoring**: Sentry tracks errors and performance issues in real time.

---

## Architecture

- **Django Project Structure**: Organized into modular apps (products, users, orders, payments) for maintainability.
- **Apps**: Each app encapsulates related models, views, serializers, and URLs.
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL stores all persistent data (products, users, orders, etc.).
- **Celery & Redis**: Celery executes background jobs; Redis acts as the message broker.
- **API Layer**: Django REST Framework (DRF) exposes resources via RESTful endpoints.
- **Settings**: Environment-based configuration for development, testing, and production.

## Key Technologies & Definitions

- **Django**: Python web framework for rapid, secure development.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- **PostgreSQL**: Advanced open-source relational database.
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue for running asynchronous jobs.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store, used as Celery's broker.
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring platform.
- **pytest**: Python testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **django-filter**: Provides filtering capabilities for DRF endpoints.
- **django-cors-headers**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for APIs.

---

## API Endpoints (RESTful)

- **Products**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, filtering, and pagination.
- **Users**: Registration, authentication (JWT), profile management, permissions.
- **Orders**: Cart management, checkout, order history.
- **Payments**: Integration with Stripe/PayPal, payment status tracking.
- **Filtering & Pagination**: Query parameters for search, filter, and paginated results.

---

## Asynchronous Tasks & Scheduling

- **Celery**: Executes background jobs (e.g., sending emails, processing orders).
- **Periodic Tasks**: Scheduled jobs (e.g., daily reports, cleanup).
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries and error logging for failed tasks.

---

## Security Features & Definitions

- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens for secure, stateless user authentication.
- **Permissions & Roles**: Granular access control for users and admins.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing safe API access from different domains.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only valid data is processed and stored.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting request frequency.

---

## Error Monitoring & Logging

- **Sentry Integration**: Real-time error tracking and alerting.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Graceful error responses in views and APIs.
- **Logging**: Configured for audit trails and debugging.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **pytest**: Automated unit and integration tests for reliability.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensures views, models, and serializers are thoroughly tested.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated test runs on code changes.

---

## Deployment & Operations

- **Production Settings**: Secure configuration for live environments.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data (keys, passwords) managed outside code.
- **Static/Media Files**: Handled via Django's static/media system.
- **Render Deployment**: Cloud deployment for scalability and reliability.
- **Database Migrations**: Schema changes managed via Django migrations.

---

## Advanced Features

- **Filtering & Search**: django-filter enables advanced queries on endpoints.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently handles large datasets.
- **Custom Serializers**: Tailored data representation for APIs.
- **Async Views**: Improved performance for high-traffic endpoints.

Highlights:

- API endpoints are namespaced under `/api/`
- JWT via SimpleJWT; provider token exchange endpoints return a JWT
- Run `python manage.py migrate` before `runserver`
