## UI/UX Features Explained

- **HomeScreen**: Displays product categories, electronics, and social images for easy navigation.
- **ProductListScreen**: Animated product cards, smooth transitions, and loading states.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, roles, and screen reader support for inclusive design.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Adapts seamlessly to web and mobile devices.
- **Error Boundaries**: Catches and displays errors globally for a stable user experience.

## State Management & Persistence

- **Redux Toolkit**: Centralizes app state (cart, user, products) with slices and selectors.
- **Middleware**: Handles async actions and side effects.
- **Persistence**: Cart and user state saved across sessions.

---

## Data Fetching & API Integration

- **React Query**: Fetches data from backend APIs, caches results, and updates in background.
- **Loading/Error States**: Built-in support for user feedback during API calls.
- **Integration**: Connects to backend endpoints for products, users, orders, etc.

---

## Internationalization (i18n)

- **react-i18next**: Enables multi-language support and dynamic translations.
- **Language Switching**: Users can change language on the fly.

---

## Progressive Web App (PWA) Features

- **Manifest.json**: Defines app metadata for installability.
- **Service Worker**: Enables offline caching and background sync.
- **Web Install Prompt**: Allows users to install the app on desktop/mobile.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Jest**: Automated unit tests for logic and components.
- **React Native Testing Library**: Integration and UI tests for screens.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensures reliability and maintainability.
